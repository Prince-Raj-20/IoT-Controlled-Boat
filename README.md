## ðŸ”„ How It Works

- ESP32 receives commands from the Blynk app (via Wi-Fi).
- Blynk buttons control forward/backward movement using DC motors.
- A slider/joystick in blynk controls the servo for steering.
- Motors and servo are controlled through GPIO pins.

## â–¶ Getting Started

> âš  *Note*: For security reasons, sensitive data like Blynk Auth Token and Wi-Fi credentials have been removed. Please replace the placeholders in the .ino file with your own Blynk template info and Wi-Fi details.

### âœ… Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board installed
- Blynk App (Old Blynk 1.0 or Blynk IoT depending on your code)
- Create project in Blynk App and get Auth Token

### ðŸš€ Uploading the Code
1. Connect ESP32 via USB
2. Paste your Blynk Auth Token in the code
3. Select correct COM port and ESP32 board
4. Press BOOT button on ESP32 (if needed during upload)
5. Upload the .ino code to ESP32
